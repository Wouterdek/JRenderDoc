# JRenderDoc
Java bindings for the RenderDoc API. Last updated for API version 1.1.2.
Only Windows (x86 and x64) is currently supported, although Linux/Mac support should not be hard to implement if needed.

If you want to compile this yourself, please note:
- Visual Studio 2017 or later and Maven are required to build this project.
- The header files in java_headers are autogenerated generated by maven.
  Don't edit them, because they will be overwritten on compile.
- renderdoc_app.h (the RenderDoc API header file) was copied from a x64 Windows install of RenderDoc.
- The JDK folder is set to C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-9 by default. Go to Include Directories under VC++ Directories in the project settings to change this.
